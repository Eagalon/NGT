# NGT
This is the "NGT" (New Game Toolkit).

This is a game engine that is similar to BGT in its staged functions and classes, but it has some changes.

The engine is written in C++ without any reference to AngelScript. This means that someone will not be able to decompile your exe file, extract the AngelScript bytecode, and get the source code of the game.

In addition, the engine is open source, which allows you to add something new and unique to this game engine.

Also, "BGT" is no longer supported, which caused difficulties in the development of games on "BGT". However, in "NGT", you will not have any problems with this.

Enjoy!New open source game toolkit
